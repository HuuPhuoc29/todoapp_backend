First, you can install nodemon. Nodemon is a tool that helps develop Node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

### `npm i nodemon`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `nodemon Server.js`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in your browser.

In this project, I often use these documents for project implementation.

Going forward, I want to improve it to be more user-friendly. Add the functionality to adjust the date and time of each task. An alarm can be specified for each user-defined task. In addition, I want to expand it on the mobile application to meet the needs of users.
